# About RetroMaster

Who needs a ScrumMaster to facilitate the team retro when you have RetroMaster?

RetroMaster is a small Python3 program that's purely intended for giggles. It is
not flawless, it's not perfect, but hey, it makes for a fun and alternative way
of reflecting on your sprint.

# Usage
```bash
python3 retromaster.py
```
